      <description>Meta Overview Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that you should do to help set yourself up for success. All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on August 27th. Before you do anything else, though, you should read through the Syllabus. Make sure you have a good sense of what is required for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!</description>

      <description>Meta Overview This course is built primarily around a trio of software applications - the programming language R, the graphical user interface for R called RStudio, and GitHub Desktop. As I noted on the course onboarding page, there are two choices for accessing software and two choices for installing software. Please read through the course onboarding page page carefully and make the decisions you think are best for you. Feel free to shoot me a message on Slack or via email if you have questions about which approach is best.</description>

Lecture Slides  Creating Correlation Tables As we discuss this week, R&amp;rsquo;s correlation output leaves much to be desired relative to statistical software applications like Stata or SAS. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a function (based on a few others that are floating around) that adds a bit of flexibility and precision to the correlation calculation process, and returns output with correlation coefficients and statistical significance values combined.</description>
