At the very end of our first class, we introduced some basic aspects of R and RStudio. The video above summarizes what we went over and introduces some new functions as well. Please watch this before tackling the week two materials.

An additional resource is RStudio's {{< link "cheatsheet" "https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf" >}} that covers the basics of their software.

### Installing Packages

For those students using Docker, there should not be a need to install packages this semester. We did practice doing so with one package, however. In RStudio's console, we entered the following code:

```r
install.packages("cowsay")
```
