## Overview

Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that you should do to help set yourself up for success. **All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on August 27th.** Before you do *anything* else, though, you should read through the [**Syllabus**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/). Make sure you have a good sense of what is *required* for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!

## Onboarding Checklist
This section provides details on completing the following steps:

* Read through the [**Syllabus**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/)
* [Account signups](/course-onboarding/#account-signups):
  * Slack
  * GitHub
* Make some decisions about accessing [course software](/course-onboarding/#course-software)
* [Get access to books](/course-onboarding/#get-access-to-books)
* [Purchase other required materials](/course-onboarding/#other-materials)
* Read through the [Code of Conduct](/course-onboarding/#code-of-conduct)
* Complete the [student information sheet and diagnostic assessment](/course-onboarding/#administrative-tasks)
* [Complete the initial coursework](/course-onboarding/#coursework)

## Account Signups
### Get Started with Slack
We'll be using the messaging platform [Slack](https://slack.com) as a space for "virtual office hours". Slack is a messaging system used by teams of all kinds. If you can text, you can use Slack. You will need to sign-up for the SOC 4015 & SOC 5050 Slack organization [here](https://join.slack.com/t/slu-soc5050/signup). You will need to complete the signup process even if you use Slack for other purposes. Consider installing either the [desktop or the mobile apps](https://slack.com/downloads/) for Slack to keep in touch and receive push alerts!

### Get Started with GitHub
The service that is hosting this website is called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials (like websites). We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com/). If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one. 

Once you have a GitHub user name, send Chris a Direct Message via Slack with it so that you can be added to the [SOC 4015 & SOC 5050 organization](https://github.com/slu-soc5050). After you have been added to the organization, you should find your assignments repository and check the **Issues** tab. There should be an open **Issue** describing how feedback will be disseminated this semester. Please read it and then *close the issue* so that we know you've seen it.

## Course Software
There are two options for *accessing* the course software, and some instructions for how *install* it. Please read through these options carefully and make the decision that is best for you.

### Options for Accessing Software
One option for accessing the software is to **use your own computer**. If you decide to go this route, please read the next two subsections on installing software and computer prep, and then head over to the [course software](/course-software/) page to continue setting up your computer. As long as you have a relatively new computer (within the last few years), you should have no problem using any of the applications for this class. 

The other option is to rely on the **computers in our classroom**, and - lucky you(!) - you get 24-hour access to Morrissey Hall for the semester. If you decide to go this route, you can go right to the [course software](/course-software/) page to continue setting up your computer.

### Computer Prep
If you are using **your own computer**, you should do the following before proceeding:

1. Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.

2. We'll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date. You can get anti-virus software for free from SLU. Go to `ITS Software Downloads` under `Tools` on [mySLU](https://myslu.slu.edu/tools).

3. You'll also need to download files, so you'll need to make sure you have some free space on your hard drive. If you have less than 10GB of free space, you should de-clutter!

4. Make sure you know how to access your computer's file management system.
  - On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app.
  - On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows File Explorer.

## Get Access to Books
A full list of books that are required for this course is available in the [syllabus](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/readings.html). You will need to make a few decisions up front. One of the books must be purchased, but you will have to decide if you want an ebook or a physical copy:

* Wheelan, Charles. 2014. *Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data*. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company.
    * This book can be purchased in the bookstore or online. Ebook versions are available.

For two other books, you will have to decide whether you want to use the free versions available online or for `.pdf` download or if you would rather purchase physical copies:

* Diez, David M., Christopher D Barr, and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel-Runde. 2015. *OpenIntro Statistics*. 3rd edition. OpenIntro.
    * This book is **not** available from the Bookstore. You can [download a free copy](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) or purchase a physical copy from Amazon ([black & white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1943450048/) or [color](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1943450056/)).
* Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2017. *R for Data Science*. O’Reily Media: Sebastopol, CA.
    * This book book can be purchased in the bookstore, online, or accessed for free [as a webbook](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

## Other Materials
The other item to purchase is a 1.5" three-ring binder (like high school! extra points for a [Trapper Keeper](http://mentalfloss.com/article/52726/history-trapper-keeper)!!). While all course materials are available online, they are often easier to use if they are printed. Each week you'll receive various handouts, including cheat sheets for `R`, an illustration of the workflow we are focused on, the lab, and the problem set. The handouts are designed with generous margins to facilitate note-taking on them, and they'll be distributed with holes already punched in them. Keeping these in a three-ring binder will help you refer back to your notes at a later date. You should also purchase dividers, either 16 (one for each week) or 8 (if you want to organize handouts by categories).

## Code of Conduct

The [syllabus describes](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/compassionate-coursework.html) the Code of Conduct that is included each of the [GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/) repositories with this course. The syllabus description reads in part:

> you should familiarize themselves with Contributor Covenant’s Code of Conduct, which is increasingly included in open source projects and is included with each lecture repository on GitHub. The Code of Conduct lays out expectations for how all students should to conduct themselves.

Before moving forward with the onboarding tasks, please read through both the syllabus section on [compassionate coursework](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/compassionate-coursework.html) as well as the copy of the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/lecture-01/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) included in the [`lecture-01` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/lecture-01).

## Administrative Tasks
There are two forms that all students must fill out by Monday **August 27th**:

1. the [Student Information Sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/dF9cHb2ejE3LX9PD3), which gives me some info about you and gives you the chance to let me know about any initial concerns you might have.

2. the un-graded [Diagnostic Assessment](https://goo.gl/forms/vMpgDNaSH5FTfJZp1), which is designed to get a sense of where each student's math skills are currently. Please don't consult outside materials as you do this - if you are not sure how to answer, please choose "I'm not sure" instead of guessing. If you look answers up it defeats the purpose of this exercise!

## Coursework
Coursework tasks that need to be completed are listed on the syllabus under [Course Preview](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/course-preview.html) and are linked to from the [course preview page](/course-preview/):

1. Complete the [Lecture Prep 01](https://goo.gl/forms/w7ty7k9Cl0hWUVUs2) form that shows you have completed this course onboarding process. Do this *after* you have finished the course onboarding process.
2. Complete the reading and watch the posted videos shown under [Course Preview](/course-preview/)
3. Answer and submit the questions for [Lecture Prep 02](https://goo.gl/forms/yjn69cn5ZeSBuRA43)

Additionally, you'll need to complete the readings for [Lecture 01](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/lecture-01-course-introduction.html)
