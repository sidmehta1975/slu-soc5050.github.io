## Introducing R and RStudio
{{< youtube eQRjfpoFP0U >}}

At the very end of our first class, I introduced some basic aspects of R and RStudio. Since it was rushed, I've put together a quick video that summarizes what we went over and introduces some new functions as well. Please watch this before tackling the week two materials.

I have also posted a [quick reference sheet](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Week-01/tree/master/Functions) for relevant `R` functions for the week. **This was updated on September 10, 2017.** If you want an additional resource, RStudio has published a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) that covers the basics of their software.
