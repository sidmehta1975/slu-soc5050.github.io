## Correlation with Binary Variables
There is one point missing from today's lecture that comes up on the lab. I mentioned that the assumptions of correlation are that `x` and `y` are continous. Given some of the details we've already covered with the binomial distribution, we can extend Pearson's *r* to binary variables as well. These are interpretd slightly differently, since there is not "increase" in the binary variable in practical terms. We interpret them in relation to the `1` or `TRUE` category:

> The correlation (r = .54, p < .001) between x, a binary variable, and y, suggests that the TRUE category is associated with an increase in y.
