## Overview

The final project corresponds to the fourth course learning outcome, which is described in the <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus" target="_blank">**Syllabus**</a> as:

> 4) Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using `R`), and present (using `knitr` as well as the word processing and presentation applications of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.

All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050).

## Waypoints (All Students)

The final project instructions include "waypoints" - designated check-in times for students to ensure that everyone continues to make consistent forward progress throughout the semester (see the <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus" target="_blank">**Syllabus**</a> and the <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io/final-project" target="_blank">**Directions**</a>). The next waypoint will be highlighted with **bold** font throughout the semester.
