## Overview
There are a number of course resources you should be aware of. This space is meant to provide quick links to these items.

## Course Website
This [**course website**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) will be updated regularly throughout the semester. There are dedicated pages for each week as well as the [final project](/final-project/). Each page include links to lecture slides, YouTube videos, and notes about specific topics. There are also additional resources for navigating topics and course software.

## Syllabus
The [**syllabus**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/) is available online. This spells out everythng that is **required** for the course. If you would like a `.pdf` record of the syllabus, you can download a "first day" version of the syllabus (that will not be updated subsequently) on the syllabus page.

## GitHub Organization
[**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050) will be used to host all course content so that it can easily be downloaded. Links to specific repositories and documents are available on each lecture page for this website, and your individual assignment repository can be viewed by going to the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050) organization and searching through the available repos.

## Slack
[**Slack**](https://slu-soc5050.slack.com) is a communication platform for groups. We'll use **Slack** this semester to stay in touch, provide updates on the course, and as a space for virtual office hours.

## Readings
Below are quick links to web-based readings. Please consult the [**syllabus**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/) for a full list of readings as well as dates when they need to be competed.

* [Electronic Reserves](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=4487)
* [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php)
* [*`R` for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
* [*Sociospatial Data Science*](https://chris-prener.github.io/SSDSBook/)

## Speaker Deck
Given their large size, slides for lectures are not hosted in GitHub. I use GitHub's service [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/chrisprener) to host slides for this course. A slide deck is embedded in each lecture page on the course website and will be updated with the latest version of the slides before each lecture. 

Here are a couple of tips for using Speaker Deck:

1. **Slide numbers:** Hovering your mouse over the progress bar at the bottom of the slide deck will reveal slide numbers, which can be useful for taking notes.
2. **Downloading slides:** Slides can be downloaded by clicking on the Speaker Deck logo in the upper left-hand corner of the deck, then clicking Download PDF from the Share menu on the right-hand side of the page.
