## Overview
There are a number of course resources you should be aware of. This space is meant to provide quick links to these items.

## Course Website
This [**course website**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) will be updated regularly throughout the semester. There are dedicated pages for each week as well as the [final project](/final-project/). Each page include links to lecture slides, YouTube videos, and notes about specific topics. There are also additional resources for navigating topics and course software.

## Syllabus
The **{{< link "syllabus" "https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/">}}** is available online. This spells out everythng that is **required** for the course. If you would like a `.pdf` record of the syllabus, you can download a "first day" version of the syllabus (that will not be updated subsequently) on the syllabus page.

## GitHub Organization
**{{< link "GitHub" "https://github.com/slu-soc5050/">}}** will be used to host all course content so that it can easily be downloaded. Links to specific repositories and documents are available on each lecture page for this website, and your individual assignment repository can be viewed by going to the **{{< link "GitHub" "https://github.com/slu-soc5050/">}}** organization and searching through the available repos.

It is highlighy recommended that you clone all course repositories so that you can easily keep them updated. Details on this process can be found in my [*Sociospatial Data Science* handbook](https://chris-prener.github.io/SSDSBook/basic-git.html).

## Slack
[**Slack**](https://slu-soc5050.slack.com) is a communication platform for groups. We'll use **Slack** this semester to stay in touch, provide updates on the course, and as a space for virtual office hours.

## Readings
Below are quick links to web-based readings. Please consult the **{{< link "syllabus" "https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/">}}** for a full list of readings as well as dates when they need to be competed.

## Speaker Deck
Given their large size, slides for lectures are not hosted in GitHub. I use GitHub's service {{< link "Speaker Deck" "http://speakerdeck.com/chrisprener">}} to host slides for this course. A slide deck is embedded in each lecture page on the course website and will be updated with the latest version of the slides before each lecture. *You do not need a Speaker Deck account to view or download the slides.*

To **view** slides in a larger format, hover your mouse over the given deck and click on the lecture title, which will begin with "SOC 4015 & SOC 5050...". This will take you take you to a larger view of the lecture.

To **download** slides from this larger view, look for the download icon in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. It will be an icon with a downward pointing arrow.
