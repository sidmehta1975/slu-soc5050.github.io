There are a number of course resources you should be aware of. This space is meant to provide quick links to these items.

## Course Website
This [**course website**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) will be updated regularly throughout the semester. There are dedicated pages for each week as well as the [final project](/final-project/). Each page include links to lecture slides, YouTube videos, and notes about specific topics. There are also additional resources for navigating topics and course software.

## Syllabus
The [**syllabus**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus/) is available online. This spells out everythng that is **required** for the course. If you would like a `.pdf` record of the syllabus, please clone the [`Core-Documents`](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents) repository from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050).

## GitHub Organization

Links to specific repositories and documents are available on each lecture page for this website, and your individual assignment repository can be viewed by going to the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050) organization and searching through the available repos.

## Slack
