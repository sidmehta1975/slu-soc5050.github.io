## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis for both undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bivariate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced along with essential skills for cleaning data, creating plots, and reporting results. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines.

## Course Objectives
This course has four intertwined objectives. After completing the course, students will be able to:

1. *Fundamentals of inferential statistics*:  Describe the use of various statistical tests, their requirements and assumptions, and their interpretation; execute these tests both by hand and programmatically using `R`.

2. *Fundamentals of data analysis*:  Perform basic data cleaning and analysis tasks programmatically using `R` in ways that support high quality documentation and replication.

3. *Fundamentals of data visualization*:  Create and present publication quality plots programmatically using `R` and `ggplot2`.

4. *Quantitative research synthesis*:  Plan, implement (using `R`), and present (using LaTeX and the presentation software of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.
