This course is built primarily around a trio of software applications - the programming language `R`, the graphical user interface for `R` called RStudio, and GitHub Desktop. As I noted on the [course onboarding page](/getting-started/#course-software), there are two choices for *accessing* software and two choices for *installing* software. Please read through the [course onboarding page](/getting-started/#course-software) page carefully and make the decisions you think are best for you. Feel free to shoot me a message on Slack or via email if you have questions about what approach is best.

## Coursework with Docker


## Coursework Local Installations of `R`
If you decide to manage your own local installation of `R` this semester. 

### Software Downloads
There are two applications you will need to download and install.

1. The computing language `R` needs to be downloaded and installed. You can download it from the [`R`'s website](https://cloud.r-project.org). Choose "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows". Windows users should look for a link that says "install R for the first time". Both macOS and Windows users should install `R` version 3.5.0, known as "Joy in Playing".[^1] **If you already have `R` installed on your computer, make sure you are running version 3.5.0.**

2. RStudio is a graphical user interface for `R` that will make learning the language and using it much, much easier. You should download the *free* version of RStudio from [their website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose the appropriate installer for your platform. Make sure `R` is already installed before installing RStudio. **If you already have RStudio installed on your computer, make sure you are running version 1.1.477.**

### Install `R` Packages
There are a number of `R` packages that you will need for this semester. 

## GitHub Desktop
In addition to the applications above, everyone will need a local installation of GitHub Desktop, which is a graphical user interface for accessing Git and GitHub.com. It can be downloaded for free from the application's [website](https://desktop.github.com). You will need to download and run the installer. Once it is complete, you will need to login to the application with your [GitHub.com username and password](/getting-started/#account-signups).

[^1]: All of `R`'s version names are taken from the [Peanuts comic strip](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names/).
