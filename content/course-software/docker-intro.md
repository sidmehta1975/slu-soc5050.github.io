### Options for Installing Software
Regardless of how you are accessing the software for this class, there are two options for installing the core applications `R` and RStudio as well as their associated dependencies. The first option is to use a virtual installation of `R` and RStudio. This uses an application called [Docker](http://docker.com) to create a virtual instance of `R` and RStudio that you can access via your browser. All of the packages required for the semester will already be pre-loaded, so Docker requires less time to get up and running. 

This first option is recommended if you are using a lab computer, you are brand new to `R`, are less comfortable with computers, and/or are not sure whether or not you'll be using `R` after the end of the semester. Instructions for getting started with Docker be found on the [course software](/course-software/) page. **If you decide to use Docker installed on a computer lab machine, please try to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early on the first day of class to get your Desktop up and running.**

The second option is to manage your own installation. This is recommended if you have used `R` before, are comfortable with computers, and is particularly recommended if you are using your own computer and plan to continue using `R` after the semester ends. Instructions for managing your own installation can be found on the [course software](/course-software/) page.
