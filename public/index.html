<p>SOC 4930 &amp; 5050 is <a href="https://www.slu.edu/">Saint Louis University</a> <a href="https://www.slu.edu/department-of-sociology-and-anthropology">Sociology&rsquo;s</a> undergraduate and graduate introductory statistics course, which will next be offered in Fall, 2017. This site is for sections taught by Assistant Professor <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io">Christopher Prener</a>.</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis for both undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bivariate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced along with essential skills for cleaning data, creating plots, and reporting results. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines.</p>

<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>

<p>This course has four intertwined objectives. After completing the course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Fundamentals of inferential statistics</em>:  Describe the use of various statistical tests, their requirements and assumptions, and their interpretation; execute these tests both by hand and programmatically using <code>R</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Fundamentals of data analysis</em>:  Perform basic data cleaning and analysis tasks programmatically using <code>R</code> in ways that support high quality documentation and replication.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Fundamentals of data visualization</em>:  Create and present publication quality plots programmatically using <code>R</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Quantitative research synthesis</em>:  Plan, implement (using <code>R</code>), and present (using LaTeX and the presentation software of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="course-resources">Course Resources</h2>

<p>There a number of core documents and resources for this course. The <strong><a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></strong> sets out core expectations and policies for the course. The <strong><a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf">Reading List</a></strong> contains topics, readings (both required and optional), and assignment due dates for each week. These two documents spell out what is <em>required</em> for this course. Both of these course documents are available in the <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/"><code>Core-Documents</code></a> repository on <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a website designed for collaboratively working on programming and data analysis projects, and we will use it extensively this semester. Each week&rsquo;s lecture slides, notes, and assignments will be posted in individual <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-repositories/">repositories</a>. Students will submit all of their work on branches in their assignments repository, and feedback will be given via GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/">Issues</a> feature.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io/User-Guide/index.html">User&rsquo;s Guide</a></strong> is a companion document that is written with the aim of helping you be <em>successful</em> in this course. The idea behind a course <strong>User&rsquo;s Guide</strong> is to create a reference for many of the intangible, subtle or disparate skills and ideas that contribute to being a successful researcher. It is designed to be a living document and is therefore available as part of this website. A <code>pdf</code> version of the <strong>User&rsquo;s Guide</strong> is also available for students wishing to download a physical copy.</p>

<p>We will also use GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/">wiki tool</a> to maintain a <strong><a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/wiki/">Course Wiki</a></strong> throughout the semester. The <strong>Wiki</strong> will serve as a place to post weekly jotters that provide links to more information, descriptions of issues that are arising with particular parts of the course, and course related announcements. Our <strong>Wiki</strong> will be associated with the <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/"><code>Core-Documents</code></a> repository on <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we will be utilizing the communication service <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> to stay in touch. Our <strong><a href="https://slu-soc5050.slack.com/">Slack team</a></strong> allows me to post announcements and updates about the course that you will receive alerts to. Any changes to our course GitHub repositories will also be posted there automatically. Slack will also provide us with a space to host virtual office hours on channels dedicated to particular applications and topics.</p>
