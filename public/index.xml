      <description>Lecture Slides  Introducing R and RStudio   At the very end of our first class, I introduced some basic aspects of R and RStudio. Since it was rushed, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a quick video that summarizes what we went over and introduces some new functions as well. Please watch this before tackling the week two materials.
I have also posted a quick reference sheet for relevant R functions for the week.</description>
