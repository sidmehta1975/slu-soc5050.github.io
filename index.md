### Course Description
This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis for graduate students with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bivariate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines.

### Course Objectives
This course has four intertwined objectives:

  1. *Fundamentals of inferential statistics*: Describe the use of various statistical tests, their requirements and assumptions, and their interpretation; execute these tests both by hand and programmatically using Stata.
  2. *Fundamentals of data analysis*: Perform basic data cleaning and analysis tasks programmatically using Stata in ways that support high quality documentation and replication.
  3. *Fundamentals of data visualization*: Create and present publication-quality plots programmatically using Stata.
  4. *Quantitative research synthesis*: Plan, implement, and present a research project that uses a large, publicly available sociology dataset known as the General Social Survey.

### Core Resources
If you want to learn more about the course, you can check out the core course resources.

The [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) sets out core expectations and policies for the course. The [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf) contains topics, readings (both required and optional), and assignment due dates for each week. These two documents spell out what is *required* for this course and are available in the `Core-Documents` repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050).

The [**User's Guide**](/pages/user-guide.html) is a companion document that is written with the aim of helping students be *successful* in this course. The idea behind a course [**User's Guide**](/pages/user-guide.html) is to create a reference for many of the intangible, subtle or disparate skills and ideas that contribute to being a successful researcher. This is designed to be a living document, and therefore I make it available as part of the [course website](/pages/user-guide.html).

Finally, We will use GitHub's [wiki tool](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) to maintain a [**Course Wiki**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/wiki) throughout the semester. I will use this as a place to post weekly jotters that provide links to more information, descriptions of issues that are arising with particular parts of the course, and course related announcements.
